NOTES:
This very basic shmup, based on haxecoder's haxepunk shooter, is to practice 
and test to see if it was possible to use Composure and Haxeflixel together in
an ECS paradigm.

I would call it a general success, with a bit of duct tape there and there.
It's still a little disorganized for my tastes, in terms of lines in the main 
Play state, but it works.

However, I did not employ the ECS paradigm when creating the rudimentary UI. I
decided to tackle that mountain another time.
