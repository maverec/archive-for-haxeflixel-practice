old practice code for haxeflixel and composure

most of this code contains a lot of trial and error, trying to see if it was possible to get haxeflixel and composure to work together

things are probably different now since haxeflixel underwent quite a few changes that may make it more compatible with composure but I have yet to make any attempts
